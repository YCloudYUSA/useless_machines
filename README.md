# useless_machines
Modules that turn themselves off.

> A useless machine or useless box is a device whose only function is to turn itself off.

These modules exist solely to replace modules that have been [accidentally removed from your Drupal site](https://www.drupal.org/docs/updating-drupal/troubleshooting-database-updates#s-manually-removing-a-missing-theme-or-module). Upon `updb` they disable themselves, automagically removing the missing module from your configuration.

## But... no... ðŸ˜¢

### I still want to use a few of these modules

If you are using a package that requires `useless_machines` (like [YMCA Website Services](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny/blob/main/composer.json#L159)) but you still need one of these modules:

- fork this repo
  - remove the line of any module you want to use from the `conflict` section in `composer.json`
  - remove the corresponding directory
- swap out your fork by [using an inline alias](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/aliases.md#require-inline-alias) in **your project's** `composer.json`.

### I don't want any of these useless machines 

Fret not, we've got [a branch for you](https://github.com/YCloudYUSA/useless_machines/tree/allow-contrib). 

```
composer require ycloudyusa/useless_machines:"dev-allow-contrib as dev-main"
```
